# Food-eats

Project simulating a food delivery. You must select the food you want and click on confirm, this way you will be directed to whatsapp to finalize the order. (You will be finalizing the order in my Whatsapp, so feel free to send it, so I'll know you are testing my app, any feedback is welcome :D)
